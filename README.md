**Project Overview: Bitcoin vs. S&P 500 Regression & Forecasting**

Description
This project analyzes the statistical relationship between the cryptocurrency market represented by Bitcoin and the traditional stock market represented by the S&P 500 index. By examining historical data from November 2015 to March 2025, the project aims to determine if these two distinct financial assets move in tandem and uses time-series modeling to forecast future Bitcoin price movements.

**Key Objectives**
To clean, process, and merge historical financial data for comparative analysis.
To visualize long-term price trends and daily market volatility.
To calculate statistical correlations between asset prices and their daily returns.
To implement a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to predict future Bitcoin returns based on the interaction between the two markets.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation, merging, and time-series indexing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualizations including line charts and regression plots.
Plotly: Interactive graphs for comparing daily log returns.
Statsmodels: Implementation of the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model for forecasting.
Numpy: Numerical operations for logarithmic calculations.

Results
Long-term Trend: While Bitcoin and the S&P 500 often rise together in the long run (high price correlation), their daily fluctuations are mostly uncorrelated, highlighting Bitcoin's potential as a non-correlated asset in a diversified portfolio.

Forecasting: The VAR model successfully generates short-term directional predictions for Bitcoin returns, providing a data-driven approach to anticipating market movement.

The model will be improved soon.
